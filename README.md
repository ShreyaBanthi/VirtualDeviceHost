# Virtual Device Host

## Description

This solution allows to decouple communicating "Internet of Things"-based devices.
This decoupling allows to simplify device communication and usage as well as to influence the exchanged data. 
Exchanged data can then be aggregated, projected or simply modified to be published to a MQTT broker as data of a so-called *virtual device*. Effectively, this allows to virtualize IoT devices and thus abstract from existing sensors and actors.
Focus of the solution lies in extensibility as well as configurability to allow the solution to potentially act as a platform for future projects.
